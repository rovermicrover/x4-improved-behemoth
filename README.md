# About

The Behemoth has less shields and turrets than the Phoenix, and is slower. It is far better than the Phoenix in sector because of poor turret placement but out of sector is purely worse.

This mod seeks to make the Behemoth better in sector by adding two missing turret groups to its bottom front. While it still has less shields than the Phoenix, it now has one more turret. It also buffed the Behemoths missile storage to be in line with the M1 race missile storage differences.
